                <p>
                    As an engineer, My first and foremost goal is to provide such a product to users, which is useful, easy to use, and of-course, well written.
                    The job is well done when we observe the customer satisfaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I have only one goal, the success of the product, I do not hesitate to take up many roles.
                    I became Jack-Of-All-Trades and have covered the void throughout my career.
                    My relentless attempt to excel at web development made me well versed in many technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that the software development is just like any other form of art.
                    It takes a personâ€™s creativity, knowledge and intelligence to design a beautiful and regal software.
                    I also know that time is an important factor for all the decisions that have been taken and to be taken.
                    You can rely on me to deliver the high quality project on time.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to above, I am voracious reader, technology enthusiast, curious being, and a very bad cook.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Values over money</b> - Do the right thing, not the money thing.</li>
